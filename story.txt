Long long time ago, there is a magical town located in the Placious World. This town teaches people how to become a better person and 
serve the land they are living in. There are all kinds of weird things happening in this little town. Every year, many people come here for 
greate power and many people leave here for even greater power. People call this place: "Madison". There is an amazing class called CS400 and 
four guys enrolled in this class and become teammates. Their journey starts here...

The balance of the world is contructed by two opposite things. In other word, 
there is another town named Madison too which have the exactly different situation.
People in the other "Madison" don't have power and they don't need to take CS400.
However, they are extremely unhappy with their current life: they want to go to 
our Madison. One day, people from the other Madison come to this Madison, and the
balance of the world has been corrupted.
